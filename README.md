# IrishBruse's Utilities

A [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension: snippet management, GitHub shortcuts, and small editor helpers.

**Install:** search the Marketplace for **IrishBruse's Utilities** ([publisher `irishbruse`](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/irishbruse)) or install from a `.vsix` built from [this repository](https://github.com/IrishBruse/irishbruse-utilities).

**Requirements:** VS Code `^1.110.0` (see `engines.vscode` in `package.json`).

## Features

### Snippet Manager

Tree view under the **Snippet Manager** activity bar: create, edit, and delete snippets in folders; map snippet files to [language IDs](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/overview) for highlighting; and auto-generate snippets from multiple language sources using the settings below.

### GitHub

From the Source Control title bar (when using Git), **Open Pull Request** opens the PR for the current branch in the browser (via `git`, not the GitHub CLI).

### Clipboard and paste

- **Paste Image** (Explorer context menu or command): save a clipboard image into the workspace under the selected folder.
- **Smart paste** (default keybinding): if the clipboard holds an image, save it like **Paste Image**; otherwise perform the normal editor or Explorer paste.

### Relative goto

**Relative goto** jumps by line in the active editor: relative forward, `-` prefix for relative backward, or a leading space for an absolute line number (see the command prompt when you run it).

### Theme

**Empty Dark Theme** is contributed as an optional dark UI theme (see **Preferences: Color Theme**).

## Configuration

Map snippet file labels to VS Code language IDs:

```json
{
  "ib-utilities.languageIdMappings": {
    "node": "typescript",
    "react": "typescriptreact"
  }
}
```

Control auto-generated snippet languages (left: target language ID; right: comma-separated source labels):

```json
{
  "ib-utilities.generatedLanguageMappings": {
    "typescriptreact": "node,react"
  }
}
```

## Commands

| Command | Title |

| `ib-utilities.relativeGoTo` | Relative goto |
| `ib-utilities.openSnippet` | Open Snippet |
| `ib-utilities.showSnippetView` | Show Snippet View |
| `ib-utilities.openPR` | Open Pull Request |

## Keyboard shortcuts

Default bindings from `package.json`:

| --- | --- | --- |

| `Ctrl+V` | Editor focused | Smart paste |
| `Ctrl+V` | Files Explorer focused | Smart paste |

(On macOS, `Ctrl` may appear as `⌃` in the UI; VS Code resolves keybindings per platform.)
